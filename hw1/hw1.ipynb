      " Dolce and Gabbana will not face trial after &#xa3;1bn fraud case is thrown out\n",
      "Milan judge rules there is not enough evidence to support accusations against the Italian designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana will no longer have to worry about what to wear in court. Italian fashion's most powerful design duo have been told they will not stand trial for an alleged €1bn (£880m) tax dodge after a judge in Milan threw out the case against them at a preliminary hearing. The pair have built one of the world's largest fashion brands, beloved of celebrities such as Madonna and Kylie. They were accused of fraud of around €1bn as part of an inquiry into reports the company had failed to declare €840m in revenues. Both designers, Dolce's brother Alfonso and three other senior members of the company were accused but all denied the charges. Judge Simone Luerti ruled there was not enough evidence to take the Milanese designers to trial, and closed the file on other people who had been under investigation as well. The reported allegation was that Dolce & Gabbana created a company in Luxembourg in 2004 and 2005 which was given control of the group's two brands - the main label and its younger line D&G - so avoiding Italian taxes. It is unlikely that sales of their brand of \"\"molto-sexy\"\" clothes will have been affected by this near brush with scandal. Dolce and Gabbana are a superstar partnership - there are stores in 34 countries - who have masterminded an instantly recognisable high-end Euro-look. They are central to the Milanese fashion notion of \"\"more is more\"\". Alongside super-sexy ads, the brand's success has been based on its ability to sell well-tailored suiting and glitzy party dresses alongside more affordable branded items including T-shirts, jeans, perfume, sunglasses and makeup. This is not the first controversy Dolce and Gabbana have weathered. Three years ago, they came under fire over an advertisement that was accused of exalting gang rape: it showed a woman being held down on the ground by a man while other men looked on. In 2009, Giorgio Armani accused the couple of having copied a design for quilted trousers - a charge Dolce and Gabbana contemptuously dismissed. \n",

      " Plus size fashion: Size 18 clothes CAN look stylish\n",
      "If you've ever tried to tug a poorly fitting pair of size 16 jeans over your hips in a changing room before collapsing in a dejected heap on the floor, you are not alone. One in four British women is now wearing a size 18 or above. But as Radio 4 presenter Jenni Murray admitted in this paper last week, it is almost impossible to find clothes that are both big and beautiful. So is hiding away in shapeless sacks the only solution? It most certainly is not. As a fashion stylist who has dressed celebrities of all shapes and sizes, I've discovered that every - and I mean every - woman can look good. If you know where to look, there are some fantastic companies, both on the High Street and on the internet, that have finally woken up to the fact that curvier women don't just want to crawl away and hide. My number one rule is to ditch the hard-wired belief that plus-size means frumpy. Brave the High Street and (politely, of course) demand to be noticed. There are plenty of chains that go up to your size, from Marks & Spencer and Evans to Debenhams, New Look and Monsoon. If you can't face the tyranny of badly lit dressing rooms, there are countless online stores that you can peruse from the comfort of your living room. Simply Be, Marisota, Duo, Anna Scholz, Beige Plus and Ann Harvey are a few of the best - and even trendy boutique ASOS.com has launched a fashion-forward plus-size label, ASOS Curve. So here's my pick of what's on offer, as worn by our gorgeous model Nina (bust 36DD, waist 36in, hips 46in). Enlarge Highlight your body as you would your face. Put the darkest colour on your heaviest area, or use colour to create a slim panel down the centre of your outfit. This can be done with a dark cardigan over a lighter shift dress - but this flattering frock does the work for you. Camel and black dress £60, Star by Julien MacDonald at Debenhams; jacket £40, Dorothy Perkins; ring stack £7.50, Daisy & Eve at Evans; shoes £105, duoboots.com Enlarge You can wear stripes, capes and slim-fitting trousers - it's just about wearing them well. All stripes work, whatever your dress size, if they're broken up with layering. Team them with darker trousers and try a cardigan on top. Or wear under a fun and playful cape like this one, which hides larger hips. Cape £70 and jeans £30, both Asos Curve; striped top £8.99, New Look; necklace £125, Bulatti.co.uk; sunglasses £123, Miu Miu at David Clulow; shoes £120, Ted Baker; bag £60, vivaladiva.com Enlarge This season's catwalk featured a lot of print - and there's no reason for plus-size girls to be left out. Prints are a nifty way to disguise lumps and bumps. Tall girls can pull off large, bold prints, but something subtler like this suits everyone. Break up the print with jackets or cardigans in plain colours. China print long dress £75, Evans Collection at Evans; white shrug £19.50, Evans; necklace £10, Daisy & Eve at Evans; sandals £19.99, New Look Enlarge Do you have slim legs, but worry about your hips and thighs? You can still do fitted trousers like these combats - simply layer longer pieces over the top to disguise problem areas. This lightweight parka is thin enough to wear in summer and completes the combat look. Parka £42, simplybe.co.uk; trousers £28, Indigo Collection at Marks & Spencer; yellow sleeveless shirt £19.99, New Look; belt £6, Dorothy Perkins; scarf £89, Epice at Fenwick; earrings £6.50 (part of a multipack), Daisy & Eve at Evans; ring £69, Lola Rose; shoe boots £120, duoboots.com Enlarge GET OUT OF THE LEGGINGS RUT: Harem pants are a super-comfortable alternative to leggings. You have to be fearless to wear them as there will still be volume around your hips and bum - that's part of the silhouette. But if you keep the top half short, you'll emphasise your waist. If you're concerned about the jersey fabric revealing wobbly bits, wear control tights to smooth them out. White jacket £139, Anna Scholz; blush lace top £39.50, Limited Collection at Marks & Spencer; trousers £50, Monsoon; necklace £118, Lola Rose; earrings (part of a multipack) £6.50, Daisy & Eve at Evans; shoes £120, duoboots.com Enlarge This is a fantastic shape if you've got a big bum, and it's everywhere at the moment thanks to Mad Men. This dress has a lovely V-shape neckline which helps slim a big bust, and volume in the skirt to skim over your hips and thighs. With a dress this perfect, you can get away with a daring pattern like these thick stripes on the bottom half. Red dress £59, Per Una at Marks & Spencer; cardigan £48, Monsoon; shoes £89.95, modainelle.com THE BASICS... TROUSERS: Should be higher-waisted, ideally with a smooth front and the zip at the side. SLEEVES: Are either elbow or three-quarter length — keep your eye out for cover-ups to wear over strappy tops or dresses. Avoid cap sleeves as these cut your arm at the widest point. NECKLINES: Are more flattering when lower, but you can cover up with a jersey camisole (£5 up to size 24 at Marks & Spencer). SKIRTS: Should sit smoothly across the front. A kick-out at the knee will give a balancing effect. DRESSES: Should have a back zip, not a side one. Diagonal ruching across the body is always slimming. AND DON'T FORGET... ACCESSORIES: Go for big, bold pieces. Daisy & Eve at Evans do an excellent range, with bangles and rings in all sizes. Lola Rose (lolarose.com) has a great range of stretch bangles. Use long necklaces (adele-marie.com has a good selection) and scarves to draw the eye down your body. SHOES: Evans has a great in-store range of wide-fitting shoes (up to size 11) and Duo (duoboots.com) has boot styles in calf widths up to 50cm and an amazing selection of footwear in three width fittings up to size nine. GOOD UNDERWEAR: This is essential in order to achieve the smoothest, sleekest shape you can. Simply Be (simplybe.co.uk) stocks Gok Wan’s excellent shapewear and a good selection of large bras that look feminine. Pictures: Joel Anderson. Model: Nina Hartley/excel.

      " Radioactive boars in Germany a legacy of Chernobyl\n",
      "Radioactive boars: A quarter century after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union carried a cloud of radiation across Europe, these animals are radioactive enough that people are urged not to eat them. BERLIN For a look at just how long radioactivity can hang around, consider Germany's wild boars. A quarter century after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union carried a cloud of radiation across Europe, these animals are radioactive enough that people are urged not to eat them. And the mushrooms the pigs dine on aren't fit for consumption either. Germany's experience shows what could await Japan - if the problems at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant get any worse. Nuclear power around the world The German boars roam in forests nearly 950 miles (1,500 kilometers ) from Chernobyl. Yet, the amount ofradioactive cesium-137 within their tissue often registers dozens of times beyond the recommended limit for consumption and thousands of times above normal. \"\"We still feel the consequences of Chernobyl's fallout here,\"\" said Christian Kueppers, a radiation expert at Germany's Institute for Applied Ecology in Freiburg. \"\"The contamination won't go away any time soon - with cesium's half-life being roughly 30 years, theradioactivity will only slightly decrease in the coming years.\"\" Cesium can build up in the body and high levels are thought to be a risk for various other cancers. Still, researchers who studied Chernobyl could not find an increase in cancers that might be linked to cesium. Cesium also accumulates over time in the soil, which makes boars most susceptible They snuffle through forest soil with their snouts and feed on the kinds of mushroom that tend to store radioactivity, Environment Ministry spokesman Thomas Hagbeck said. The problem is so common that now all wild boars bagged by hunters in the affected regions have to be checked for radiation. Government compensation to hunters whose quarry has to be destroyed has added up to €460,000 ($650,000) over the past 12 months, Hagbeck said. \"\"It's really sad when you have to throw out meat that is normally extraordinarily tasty,\"\" said Joachim Reddemann, managing director of Bavaria state's hunting association. Thousands of wild boars killed in southern Germany every year register unacceptable levels of radiation. It's calculated in becquerels, a measurement of radiation given off. Anything beyond 600 becquerels per kilogram isn't recommended, according to Germany's Federal Office for Radiation Protection. Normal meat has an average contamination of 0.5 becquerel per kilogram, and a German would normally consume about 100 becquerels per year from plants and dairy products, the agency said. About 2 percent of the 50,000 boars hunted are above the legal radioactivity limit, Reddemann said. And the government's radiation protection office says some mushrooms have registered up to 20 times the legal cesium limit. Even farther away in France, there is still soil contamination, though levels have dropped significantly. It is now rare to find unsafe levels of cesium in boars and mushrooms, said radiation expert Philippe Renaud of France's Institute of Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety. In Austria, too, traces of radioactive cesium remain in the soil. Along with boars and mushrooms, deer have been affected - some testing at five times the legal limit, that country's environment agency says. Japan's Fukushima plant has so far not leaked nearly as much radiation as Chernobyl, but authorities there have banned the sale of milk, spinach, cabbage and other products from surrounding regions as a precaution. European officials insist that occasionally eating contaminated boar meat or mushrooms does not pose an immediate health risk. Public health agencies are typically conservative in setting limits for radioactivity in food. Eating 200 grams of mushrooms tested seven times above the legal cesium limit, for example, would amount to the same exposure as the altitude radiation taken in during a 2,000-mile flight, according to Germany's Office for Radiation Protection. In Austria, authorities say that eating the unlikely amount of 2 pounds of contaminated boar meat that is 10 times above the legal cesium limit would amount to two-thirds of an adult's normal annual radiation intake by food. However, the possibility of exposure will not be going away anytime soon. \"\"We assume that wild game will still be similarly affected until 2025 and then very slowly recede,\"\" said Reddemann, of Bavaria's hunting association. \"\"The problem will certainly still be around for the next 100 years, and Chernobyl will still be an issue for our children and grandchildren.\"\" Nuclear power around the world \n",

      " Are Some Kids Overscheduled?\n",
      "Experts debate pros, cons of highly programmed childhood THURSDAY, March 31 (HealthDay News) - From sports practices to music lessons to community service, American kids always seem to have plenty to keep them busy. But whether they're actually too busy - reaching a tipping point detrimental to their mental and physical health - remains a topic of debate. The subject of overscheduled children has been on scientists' radar for at least a decade, said Andrea Mata, a doctoral student at Kent State University whose recent study on highly involved children was scheduled for presentation Thursday at a symposium in Montreal run by the Society for Research in Child Development. \"\"I think it's a hot topic right now,\"\" Mata said. \"\"There's definitely a mix of viewpoints. So I think a lot more research is needed to find out what's going on.\"\" The SRCD symposium will examine which children and adolescents become overscheduled, what happens at high levels of extracurricular involvement, and how factors such as school grades and aggression levels are affected. Between 70 percent and 83 percent of American children and teens claim to take part in at least one extracurricular pursuit, spending an average of five to nine hours per week in structured activities, according to the SRCD. Only 5 percent to 7 percent, however, devote more than 20 hours per week to these activities. Jean Twenge, author of the book Generation Me and a professor of psychology at San Diego State University, said data gathered between the 1950s and the 1990s indicated overscheduling rose during that period and then leveled off. \"\"Are kids really overscheduled? It's not the average experience, but that doesn't mean it's not a problem,\"\" Twenge said. \"\"Parents worry about keeping up, but it's certain types of parents who worry about it.\"\" Twenge said the ever-mounting competition for admission to the nation's top colleges compels some parents and kids to fill every spare hour with impressive-looking endeavors. Mata's study followed 1,354 children from birth through age 15, dividing them into groups based on how involved they were outside of school and home. The 43 children in the highest activity level averaged 129 minutes per week of structured activities at kindergarten, which increased to 254 minutes weekly by fifth grade. Highly involved children were more likely to be girls from more affluent families, Mata said, and their mothers had attained higher education levels. This group had higher grades and lower levels of delinquency, among other behavioral and academic measurements, compared to less-involved children, she said. \"\"We're looking at it in a much more positive way,\"\" Mata said. \"\"These highly involved kids are highly adaptive and high-functioning.\"\" Linda Balog, former executive director of the Child and Adolescent Stress Management Institute at State University of New York at Brockport, said parents should ask their children how they feel about their extracurricular pursuits and whether they feel overwhelmed and stressed. \"\"We see some kids forced into organized sports at early ages and then get so burned out that they opt not to play in high school,\"\" said Balog, an associate professor of health sciences who's teaching a course on child and adolescent stress. \"\"Sometimes parents live through their children - a sort of surrogate self,\"\" she added. \"\"I think we have to err on the side of backing off a bit . . . as opposed to everything being organized and structured.\"\" Experts note that research presented at meetings is considered preliminary until it is published in a peer-reviewed journal. \n"

      " NCAA tournament:\n",
      "Nobody will dispute that they are great coaches, and the latest evidence lies in the teams they guided to this year's Final Four. Nobody will argue that John Calipari and Jim Calhoun are saints, either. The men on the sidelines for the Kentucky-Connecticut Final Four matchup have had their share of trouble - with each other, the programs they run and the NCAA. They are a microcosm of everything that's right and wrong in college basketball - a coach-driven game where good leaders can elevate programs and players to new levels but the road to success often produces its fair share of cringeworthy dealing. Calipari leads the fourth-seeded Wildcats (29-8) against Calhoun and the third-seeded Huskies (30-9) in the second semifinal Saturday. Both coaches coaxed a turnaround out of their young, struggling teams to make unexpected trips to the game's biggest stage - the third for Calipari and fourth for Calhoun. On the eve of the game, their histories were as lively a topic as the success of their teams. One of the first questions Calipari fielded Friday was whether he is the 2000\"\"s version of former UNLV coach Jerry Tarkanian, a coach who did a lot of winning in his day but did it with his phone number firmly entrenched on the NCAA's speed dial. The question slid off the Wildcats coach as smoothly as good Kentucky bourbon. \"\"I respect everything that Jerry did - his kids, how they played, all those things,\"\" Calipari said. \"\"But, no, I think I'm the 2011 John Calipari. I don't know what that means, and I hate to talk in the third party. But I am who I am.\"\" Calipari is back in Houston, where three years ago he won two games at the regional to lead Memphis to the Final Four, only to leave that school a year later, just as the program was running into NCAA problems involving the recruitment of Derrick Rose. Calipari's first Final Four visit, with Massachusetts back in 1996, also has been scrubbed by the NCAA. Which led to another tongue-in-cheek question: How does it feel to be coaching in your first Final Four? \"\"I don't deal with that,\"\" said the 52-year-old coach, who spent four years in the NBA between his stints at UMass and Memphis. \"\"We've been here three times. Those players played those games and did what they were supposed to. I'm so proud of what they've all accomplished.\"\" He says this without apology. Though his schools suffered, Calipari was not found at fault in either of the NCAA probes. The so-called problems between Cal and Cal began during those UMass days, when the coaches were on top of each other in neighboring states - one trying to protect his turf and the other trying to carve out his own. The 68-year-old Calhoun lightheartedly reprised the complaints he raised more than a decade ago about Calipari - a Pittsburgh native trying to muscle his way through New England - but made it clear the enmity has died down as the years have passed. \"\"From a generational standpoint, to the fact that John really was trying to claim New England,\"\" Calhoun said of the lack of a true friendship with his counterpart. Then, he affected his best Boston accent: \"\"He could never say he pahked the caah in Hahvahd Yahd, he didn't know what clam chowder really was. I took (umbrage) to it, but I take (umbrage) to a lot of things.\"\" \n",

      " eBay releases iPad 2 sales\n",
      "Apple has yet to reveal its official sales numbers for the iPad 2. But Friday we got a glimpse of how the tablet is selling, as eBay released its figures for the first two weeks of sales. About 12,000 iPad 2 tablets were sold in the period between the iPad 2’s U.S. and international launches. As CNET noted, the surprise number here is that the iPad 2 is being resold in the United States at a much higher rate than was the first iPad. According to eBay’s figures, 64 percent of its iPad 2 sales are in the United States, compared with just 35 percent with the original iPad. When it comes to resales overseas, Russia snapped up the most devices — 500 — in the tablet’s first two weeks on the market, followed by Canada, Hong Kong, Japan and the United Kingdom.

gabbana will no longer have to worry about what to wear in court italian fashion most powerful design duo have been told they will not stand trial for an alleged tax dodge after a judge in milan threw out the case against them at a preliminary hearing the pair have built one of the world largest fashion brands beloved of celebrities such as madonna and kylie they were accused of fraud of around as part of an inquiry into reports the company had failed to declare in revenues both designers dolce brother alfonso and three other senior members of the company were accused but all denied the charges judge simone luerti ruled there was not enough evidence to take the milanese designers to trial and closed the file on other people who had been under investigation as well the reported allegation was that dolce gabbana created a company in luxembourg in and which was given control of the group two brands the main label and its younger line d g so avoiding italian taxes it is unlikely that sales of their brand of clothes will have been affected by this near brush with scandal dolce and gabbana are a superstar partnership there are stores in countries who have masterminded an instantly recognisable they are central to the milanese fashion notion of more is more alongside ads the brand success has been based on its ability to sell suiting and glitzy party dresses alongside more affordable branded items including jeans perfume sunglasses and makeup this is not the first controversy dolce and gabbana have weathered three years ago they came under fire over an advertisement

radioactive boars a quarter century after the chernobyl nuclear disaster in the soviet union carried a cloud of radiation across europe these animals are radioactive enough that people are urged not to eat them berlin for a look at just how long radioactivity can hang around consider germany wild boars a quarter century after the chernobyl nuclear disaster in the soviet union carried a cloud of radiation across europe these animals are radioactive enough that people are urged not to eat them and the mushrooms the pigs dine on are fit for consumption either germany experience shows what could await japan if the problems at the fukushima plant get any worse nuclear power around the world the german boars roam in forests nearly miles kilometers from chernobyl yet the amount ofradioactive within their tissue often registers dozens of times beyond the recommended limit for consumption and thousands of times above normal we still feel the consequences of chernobyl fallout here said christian kueppers a radiation expert at germany institute for applied ecology in freiburg the contamination wo go away any time soon with cesium being roughly years theradioactivity will only slightly decrease in the coming years cesium can build up in the body and high levels are thought to be a risk for various other cancers still researchers who studied chernobyl could not find an increase in cancers that might be linked to cesium cesium also accumulates over time in the soil which makes boars most susceptible they snuffle through forest soil with their snouts and feed on the kinds of mushroom that tend to store radioactivity environment ministry spokesman thomas hagbeck said the problem is so common that now all wild boars bagged by hunters in the affected regions have to be checked for radiation government compensation to hunters whose quarry has to be destroyed has added up to over the past months hagbeck said it really sad when you have to throw out meat that is normally extraordinarily tasty said joachim reddemann managing director of bavaria state hunting association thousands of wild boars killed in southern germany every year register unacceptable levels of radiation it calculated in becquerels a measurement of radiation given off anything beyond becquerels per kilogram is recommended according to germany federal office for radiation protection normal meat has an average contamination of becquerel per kilogram and a german would normally consume about becquerels per year from plants and dairy products the agency said about percent of the boars hunted are above the legal radioactivity limit reddemann said and the government radiation protection office says some mushrooms have registered up to times the legal cesium limit even farther away in france there is still soil contamination though levels have dropped significantly it is now rare to find unsafe levels of cesium in boars and mushrooms said radiation expert philippe renaud of france institute of radiation protection and nuclear safety in austria too traces of radioactive cesium remain in the soil along with boars and mushrooms deer have been affected some testing at five times the legal limit that country environment agency says japan fukushima plant has so far not leaked nearly as much radiation as chernobyl but authorities there have banned the sale of milk spinach cabbage and other products from surrounding regions as a precaution european officials insist that occasionally eating contaminated boar meat or mushrooms does not pose an immediate health risk public health agencies are typically conservative in setting limits for radioactivity in food eating grams of mushrooms tested seven times above the legal cesium limit for example would amount to the same exposure as the altitude radiation taken in during a flight according to germany office for radiation protection in austria authorities say that eating the unlikely amount of pounds of contaminated boar meat that is times above the legal cesium limit would amount to of an adult normal annual radiation intake by food however the possibility of exposure will not be going away anytime soon we assume that wild game will still be similarly affected until and then very slowly recede said reddemann of bavaria hunting association the problem will certainly still be around for the next years and chernobyl will still be an issue for our children and grandchildren nuclear power around the world   \n",

lessons to community service american kids always seem to have plenty to keep them busy but whether they actually too busy reaching a tipping point detrimental to their mental and physical health remains a topic of debate the subject of overscheduled children has been on scientists radar for at least a decade said andrea mata a doctoral student at kent state university whose recent study on highly involved children was scheduled for presentation thursday at a symposium in montreal run by the society for research in child development i think it a hot topic right now mata said there definitely a mix of viewpoints so i think a lot more research is needed to find out what going on the srcd symposium will examine which children and adolescents become overscheduled what happens at high levels of extracurricular involvement and how factors such as school grades and aggression levels are affected between percent and percent of american children and teens claim to take part in at least one extracurricular pursuit spending an average of five to nine hours per week in structured activities according to the srcd only percent to percent however devote more than hours per week to these activities jean twenge author of the book generation me and a professor of psychology at san diego state university said data gathered between the and the indicated overscheduling rose during that period and then leveled off are kids really overscheduled it not the average experience but that does mean it not a problem twenge said parents worry about keeping up but it certain types of parents who worry about it twenge said the competition for admission to the nation top colleges compels some parents and kids to fill every spare hour with endeavors mata study followed children from birth through age dividing them into groups based on how involved they were outside of school and home the children in the highest activity level averaged minutes per week of structured activities at kindergarten which increased to minutes weekly by fifth grade highly involved children were more likely to be girls from more affluent families mata said and their mothers had attained higher education levels this group had higher grades and lower levels of delinquency among other behavioral and academic measurements compared to children she said we looking at it in a much more positive way mata said these highly involved kids are highly adaptive and linda balog former executive director of the child and adolescent stress management institute at state university of new york at brockport said parents should ask their children how they feel about their extracurricular pursuits and whether they feel overwhelmed and stressed we see some kids forced into organized sports at early ages and then get so burned out that they opt not to play in high school said balog an associate professor of health sciences who teaching a course on child and adolescent stress sometimes parents live through their children a sort of surrogate self she added i think we have to err on the side of backing off a bit as opposed to everything being organized and structured experts note that research presented at meetings is considered preliminary until it is published in a journal   \n",

            ncaa tournament nobody will dispute that they are great coaches and the latest evidence lies in the teams they guided to this year final four nobody will argue that john calipari and jim calhoun are saints either the men on the sidelines for the final four matchup have had their share of trouble with each other the programs they run and the ncaa they are a microcosm of everything that right and wrong in college basketball a game where good leaders can elevate programs and players to new levels but the road to success often produces its fair share of cringeworthy dealing calipari leads the wildcats against calhoun and the huskies in the second semifinal saturday both coaches coaxed a turnaround out of their young struggling teams to make unexpected trips to the game biggest stage the third for calipari and fourth for calhoun on the eve of the game their histories were as lively a topic as the success of their teams one of the first questions calipari fielded friday was whether he is the s version of former unlv coach jerry tarkanian a coach who did a lot of winning in his day but did it with his phone number firmly entrenched on the ncaa speed dial the question slid off the wildcats coach as smoothly as good kentucky bourbon i respect everything that jerry did his kids how they played all those things calipari said but no i think i the john calipari i do know what that means and i hate to talk in the third party but i am who i am calipari is back in houston where three years ago he won two games at the regional to lead memphis to the final four only to leave that school a year later just as the program was running into ncaa problems involving the recruitment of derrick rose calipari first final four visit with massachusetts back in also has been scrubbed by the ncaa which led to another question how does it feel to be coaching in your first final four i do deal with that said the coach who spent four years in the nba between his stints at umass and memphis we been here three times those players played those games and did what they were supposed to i so proud of what they all accomplished he says this without apology though his schools suffered calipari was not found at fault in either of the ncaa probes the problems between cal and cal began during those umass days when the coaches were on top of each other in neighboring states one trying to protect his turf and the other trying to carve out his own the calhoun lightheartedly reprised the complaints he raised more than a decade ago about calipari a pittsburgh native trying to muscle his way through new england but made it clear the enmity has died down as the years have passed from a generational standpoint to the fact that john really was trying to claim new england calhoun said of the lack of a true friendship with his counterpart then he affected his best boston accent he could never say he pahked the caah in hahvahd yahd he did know what clam chowder really was i took umbrage to it but i take umbrage to a lot of things   \n",

Особенно хорошо это заметно, если смотреть на отфильтрованные варианты методов. В золотом стандарте, состоящем в основном из ключевых слов, размеченных не мной, встречается много странных словосочетаний, например, одиночных наречий или глаголов, или сочетаний с притяжательными местоимениями или теми же глаголами. В ключевых словах мы хотим видеть скорее существительные, одиночные или с каким-то зависимыми. Получается, несмотря на относительно низкие значения метрик, проблема не в выдаче алгоритмов, которая мне кажется разумной, а в референсных ключевых словах, заданных не мной.  \n",

    "С таким золотым стандартом гораздо выше стала полнота, у tf-idf она достигла максимальных 0.74 балла. Общая ф-мера тоже максимальная для tf-idf, а точность - для textrank с фильтрами.  \n",
    "Но в целом точность ощутимо упала для всех методов. Я связываю это с тем, что все алгоритмы предсказывали много ключевых слов, намного больше, чем в этом золотом стандарте. Логично, что чем больше слов называть, чем больше раз пытаться угадать заданные слова, тем больше будет и ложнопозитивных, и ложноотрицательных ответов, соответственно, точность будет падать, а полнота - расти. Однако для распознавания слов, на мой взгляд, точность важнее, потому что мы хотим снизить число ложнопозитивных ответов: нам лучше упустить какие-то релевантные ключевые слова, чем запутать пользователя, назвав ему слова, не передающие смысл текста.    \n",
    "\n",
    "В целом получается, что проблема в этой задаче - не алгоритмы, а референсные стандарты. Единственное дополнение, которое мне видится возможным для текстов, - добавить лемматизацию к преобработке, что в английских существительных будет выражаться в основном в приведении к единственному числу. Я не стала делать этого сразу, чтобы сделать ключевые слова читаемыми и понятными для человека, чтобы, например, clothes и jeans не превратились в cloth и jean. Однако это может помочь алгоритмам лучше учитывать слова, которые встречаются в текстах и в единственном, и во множенственном числе."
